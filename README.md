#### Semantic Elements

Semantic elements describe the meaning of their contents, for example, `<p>` specifies its content is a paragraph, while `<div>` and `<span>` are generic containers for styling purposes. 

- `<div>`: a block-level element that is commonly used to identify a large group of contents.
- `<span>`: an inline-level element that is commonly used to identify a smaller group of contents.
